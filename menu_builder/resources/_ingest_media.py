    You are an expert document layout specialist and a web developer.
    Your task is to reconstruct a multi-page document as a single, well-formatted HTML file.

    You will be given the full text content of the original document, separated by page markers, and a list of image filenames. The filenames are descriptive of the menu items they represent.

    **INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  Read through the original document text.
    2.  When you encounter a menu item in the "Detailed Menu Plan" section that clearly matches an image filename from the provided list, you **must** insert the corresponding image directly after that item's description.
    3.  **CRITICAL PATH INSTRUCTION: All image src paths MUST be relative and use the format `images/FILENAME.png`. Do NOT include any other parent folders.**
    4.  Use appropriate HTML tags for structure (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).
    5.  Preserve the overall structure and content of the original document.
    6.  Your final output must be a single, complete HTML code block, starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and ending with `</html>`. Do not add any commentary before or after the code.

    **IMAGE FILENAMES AVAILABLE:**
    {images_list_str}

    **ORIGINAL DOCUMENT TEXT:**
    {pages_text_str}
